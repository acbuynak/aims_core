# Motoman_AIMS

An developmental application of ROS-Industrial for Yaskawa Motoman robots.

### Background

The newly formed Artificially Intelligent Manufacturing Systems (AIMS) Lab at CDME offers a unique opportunity to blend business and academia to develop applications for AI in manufacturing across military, aerospace, welding, and assembly specializations. With four Yaskawa Motoman Industrial Robots in the lab, we have the ability to recreate many common setups found in industry. This allows us the flexibility to develop practical applications of upcoming research areas.

We are currently implementing the Robot Operating System (ROS) framework to allow distributed control of our robots. ROS enables a central computer to drive all four robots remotely, in real-time, using information collected from multiple camera sources. Using this network, a programmed computer will be able to identify unique objects (such as different parts) to be picked up and manipulated in space by the robots - without human guidance!
